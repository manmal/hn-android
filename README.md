HN (Android)
============

hsagdhjgshfgjhgsafh

This is the official repo for **HN**, an unofficial Hacker News client for Android, built for reliability and usability.  
[Download the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelmaly.hn) and read the [introductory blog post](http://manuelmaly.com/blog/HN-Hacker-News-Reader/).

If you find any issues, please post them into the [Issues section](https://github.com/manmal/hn-android/issues), send a
[Pull request](https://github.com/manmal/hn-android/pulls), or tweet me at [@manuelmaly](https://twitter.com/manuelmaly/).

Note about Pull Requests: If you commit your additions into feature branches (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) instead of
the master branch, you will have no problems later on when you pull in updates from my repo. If you do that, you always have a clean
master branch at all times (meaning it does not contain anything other than my repo's master branch commits).

Setup
-----

1. Clone to a folder on your harddisk (```git clone git@github.com:manmal/hn-android.git```) - if you will use Eclipse, you can instead use EGit and skip step 3
2. Make sure you have an SDK version of >= Android 2.2 (API Level 8) installed
3. Import the project to Eclipse, and select an available Android SDK target if it complains that "Android 2.2" is not available on your system
