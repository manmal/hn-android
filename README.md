If you find any issues, please post them into the [Issues section](https://github.com/manmal/hn-android/issues), send a
[Pull request](https://github.com/manmal/hn-android/pulls), or tweet me at [@manuelmaly](https://twitter.com/manuelmaly/).

Note about Pull Requests: If you commit your additions into feature branches (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) instead of
the master branch, you will have no problems later on when you pull in updates from my repo. If you do that, you always have a clean
master branch at all times (meaning it does not contain anything other than my repo's master branch commits).
